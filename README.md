### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance bakcend developer, I like working with:

* [C#](https://github.com/topics/csharp)
* [Azure](https://github.com/topics/azure)
* [SQL Server](https://github.com/topics/sql-server)

Is the performance of your SQL server like a :tractor: but do you want a :rocket: ?

Do you need some Azure functions :zap: ?

Or do you want help on your Azure :cloud: solution ? 

ðŸ“« You can reach me via hello@pregress.be 

## Stackoverflow
When time permits I try to help people on stackoverflow:
